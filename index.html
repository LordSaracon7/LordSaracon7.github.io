  <p><b>Benjamin Valdez was born in Springfield, MO on July 24th, 2001 and was raised in Marshfield, MO. He grew up
  in a country neighborhood with his parents and two brothers. Shortly after his birth, his oldest brother Emilio, left
 for the naval academy and as a result, was seen less than his other brother, Alejandro. He spent most of his childhood living
 with Alejandro, and his parents. In 2012, his father sadly passed away and around the same time, his brother Alejandro was
about to leave for Kansas City to attend college, so the household fell to two members, Ben and his mother. For a
while, he lived life like this with his mother who was quite ill and growing worse over the years. Life was hard, but still
enjoyble, and he soon graduated High School. Unfortunatly, months after his graduation, his mother finally succumb to her illness
and Ben was left with the house to take care for. His brothers were living far away but he had family next door, so he made
it by in college with help from them and his brothers too. Later on, his house was sold to a family member to take care of
and Ben acquired a house for rent with his girlfriend, and lives there presently. Though his life has been quite tragic, he still
cherishes the times from childhood and still experiences happiness in life. He is hardworking and makes it his mission to have
a good life and to be happy. </b></p>

  <div class="worktext">
    <p>Benjamin has worked at the fast food restaurant Taco Bell for nearly 3 years. During that time,
    he has worked days and nights multiple times a week while attending college at the same time.
  For a long time now, he has primarily become a closer for the store and is regarded as one of the best
closers in fact. After being offered the position by his boss, Ben took up the manager position in recognition
of the hard work he does for the store and how good of a closer he is. Being his first job and with being a closer,
Ben has aquired much experience and has gained a strong work ethic. He knows, going forward, that he will
be a very hard worker and do his best job possible. </p>
